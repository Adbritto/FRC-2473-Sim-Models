![image](imgs/demo_robot.png)
## What is this?
This repo contains all of the models for robots that are used by 2473 GoldStrikers FRC team. They can be used in AdvantageScope and come configured. Each folder will contain a `README.md` file that explains what each model does. 

## Usage
Simply download the folder of the robot of your choice and place it into your AdvantageScope userAssets folder.

To do this you can navigate to `Help > Show User Assets` Folder in AdvantageScope.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended that you clone this repo into a permanent location on your computer and symlink one of the folders to your AdvantageScope user assets folder.

## Contributing Notes
Follow the steps in AdvantageScope's documentation on importing CAD models. At this point, you must only push models that are finished fine-tuning.

Make sure to include another `README.md` file in each of the model folders that contains screenshots and a description of what each component is.

## Issues
If you notice any issues with the models, create a github issue and make sure to add a picture of the bug.
